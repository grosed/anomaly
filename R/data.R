#' Machine temperature data.
#'
#' @description Temperature sensor data of an internal component of a large, industrial machine. The data contains three known anomalies.
#' The first anomaly is a planned shutdown of the machine. The second anomaly is difficult to detect and directly led to the third anomaly, a catastrophic failure of the machine.
#' The data consists of 22695 observations of machine temperature recorded at 5 minute intervals along with the date and time of the measurement. The data was obtained from the Numenta
#' Anomaly Benchmark \insertCite{AHMAD2017134}{anomaly}, which can be found at https://github.com/numenta/NAB.

#' Microarray data.
#' @description Microarray data for 41 individuals with a bladder tumour. The data consists of a log-likelihood-ratio statistic testing for the presence of a copy 
#' number variation evaluated along each individual's genome. The data was obtained from the \pkg{ecp} package (James and Mattesson, 2014) and standardised using
#' robust measures of mean and variance.

#' Kepler Lightcurve  data.
#' @description One of the most successful approaches for the detection of exoplanets is the so called transit method: A star's brightness is continuously measured over time by a
#' powerful telescope. If one or multiple planets orbit this star the recorded luminosity of the star will exhibit periodically recurring dips due to the transits of the planet in
#' front of the telescope's lens -- an effect comparable to that of an eclipse. Given how small planets are compared to stars the transit signals are known to be very weak.
