#' Machine temperature data.
#'
#' @description Temperature sensor data of an internal component of a large, industrial machine. The data contains three known anomalies.
#' The first anomaly is a planned shutdown of the machine. The second anomaly is difficult to detect and directly led to the third anomaly, a catastrophic failure of the machine.
#' The data consists of 22695 observations of machine temperature recorded at 5 minute intervals along with the date and time of the measurement. The data was obtained from the Numenta
#' Anomaly Benchmark \insertCite{AHMAD2017134}{anomaly}, which can be found at https://github.com/numenta/NAB.

#' Simulated data.
#'
#' @description A simulated data set for use in the examples and vignettes. The data consists of 500 observations on 200 variates drawn from the standard normal distribution.
#' Within the data there are three multivariate anomalies of length 15 located at t=100, t=200, and t=300 for which the mean changes from 0 to 2. The anomalies affect
#' variates 1 to 8, 1 to 12 and 1 to 16 respectively.
