abstract = {Abstract The challenge of efficiently identifying anomalies in data sequences is an important statistical problem that now arises in many applications. Although there has been substantial work aimed at making statistical analyses robust to outliers, or point anomalies, there has been much less work on detecting anomalous segments, or collective anomalies, particularly in those settings where point anomalies might also occur. In this article, we introduce collective and point anomalies (CAPA), a computationally efficient approach that is suitable when collective anomalies are characterized by either a change in mean, variance, or both, and distinguishes them from point anomalies. Empirical results show that CAPA has close to linear computational cost as well as being more accurate at detecting and locating collective anomalies than other approaches. We demonstrate the utility of CAPA through its ability to detect exoplanets from light curve data from the Kepler telescope and its capacity to detect machine faults from temperature data.},

Both rare and common copy number variants have been reported to be associated with complex diseases, so it is important to identify both simultaneously based on a large set of population samples. We develop a proportion adaptive segment selection procedure that automatically adjusts to the unknown proportions of the carriers of the segment variants. We characterize the detection boundary that separates the region where a segment variant is detectable by some method from the region where it cannot be detected. Although the detection boundaries are very different for the rare and common segment variants, it is shown that the proposed procedure can reliably identify both whenever they are detectable. Compared with methods for single-sample analysis, this procedure gains power by pooling information from multiple samples. The method is applied to analyse neuroblastoma samples and identifies a large number of copy number variants that are missed by single-sample methods.}",
