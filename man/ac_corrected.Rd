\title{Transforms the data X to account for autocorrelation.}
\usage{
ac_corrected(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix containing the potentially multivariate data to be transformed. Each column corresponds to a component and each row to an observation.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimension as X containing the transformed data.
}
\description{
Transforms the data X to account for autocorrelation by centring and scaling. It uses the transformation \eqn{ X_{i}^{'} = \frac{X_{i}-\mu_{i}}{k_{i}\sigma_{i}}}, were \eqn{\mu_{i}}
and \eqn{\sigma_{i}} are robust estimates for the mean and standard deviation of each variate (column), \eqn{X_{i}}, of X. The estimates are calculated using the median and median
absolute deviation. The scaling \eqn{k_{i} = \surd{\left( \frac{1+\phi_{i}}{1-\phi_{i}} \right)}}, with
\eqn{\phi_{i}} a robust estimate for the autocorrelation at lag 1, is used to account for AR(1) structure in the noise.

\examples{
library(anomaly)
data(acgh)
# use the first three individuals
X<-acgh[,1:3]
# compare the medians of each variate and transformed variate
head(apply(X,2,median))
head(apply(ac_corrected(X),2,median))
# compare the variances of each variate and transformed variate
head(apply(X,2,var))
head(apply(ac_corrected(X),2,var))
