\usage{
\S4method{summary}{capa.class}(object, epoch)

\S4method{summary}{uvcapa.class}(object)

\S4method{summary}{mvcapa.class}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An S4 class produced by \code{\link{capa}}, \code{\link{uvcapa}}, \code{\link{mvcapa}} or \code{\link{pass}}.}

\item{epoch}{Numerical value. Since \code{\link{capa}}, \code{\link{uvcapa}} and \code{\link{mvcapa}} are sequential algorithms, it is possible to process a subset of the data
up to and including a given epoch. The default value for \code{epoch}is the length of the data series.}

\description{
Summary methods for S4 objects returned by \code{\link{capa}}, \code{\link{uvcapa}}, \code{\link{mvcapa}} and \code{\link{pass}}.  The output displayed depends on
the type of S4 object passed to summary. For all types, the output indicates whether the data is univariate or multivariate, the number of observations in the data, and the type of change
being detected.

For an object produced by \code{\link{capa}}, \code{summary} displays the value of \code{epoch} and two tables showing
the location of the collective and point anomalies and the variates that they affect. The table of point anomalies contains three columns showing the location, variate
and strength for each point anomaly. The table of collective anomalies contains seven columns showing the start and end position of the anomaly, the start and end lag for
each anomaly, the variates affected by each anomaly, and the change in mean and variance for the anomaly.

For an object produced by \code{\link{mvcapa}} the output of \code{summary} is the same as for an object produced by \code{\link{capa}} except that the epoch is not displayed.

For an object produced by \code{\link{uvcapa}} the output of \code{summary} is the same as for an object produced by \code{\link{mvcapa}} except that the tables do not have a variate
column (there is only one), or start and end lags.

For an object produced by \code{\link{pass}} the output of \code{summary} is TODO
