\usage{
capa(x, beta = NULL, beta_tilde = NULL, type = "meanvar",
  min_seg_len = 10, max_seg_len = NULL, max_lag = 0,
  transform = robustscale)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix with n rows and p columns containing the data which is to be inspected.}

\item{beta}{A numeric vector of length p, giving the marginal penalties. If p > 1, type ="meanvar" or type = "mean" and max_lag > 0 it defaults to the penalty regime 2' described in 
Fisch, Eckley and Fearnhead (2018). If p > 1, type = "mean" and max_lag = 0 it defaults to the pointwise minimum of the penalty regimes 1, 2, and 3 in Fisch, Eckley and Fearnhead (2018).}

\item{beta_tilde}{A numeric constant indicating the penalty for adding an additional point anomaly. It defaults to a BIC style penalty if no argument is provided.}

\item{type}{A string indicating which type of deviations from the baseline are considered. Can be "meanvar" for collective anomalies characterised by joint changes in mean and
variance (the default), "mean" for collective anomalies characterised by changes in mean only, and "poisson" if the collective anomalies are characterised by an a-typical poisson parameter.}

\item{min_seg_len}{An integer indicating the minimum length of epidemic changes. It must be at least 2 and defaults to 10.}

\item{max_seg_len}{An integer indicating the maximum length of epidemic changes. It must be at least min_seg_len and defaults to Inf.}

\item{max_lag}{A non-negative integer indicating the maximum start or end lag. Default value is 0.}
